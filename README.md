## Let's Eat
Let's Eat is a food ordering application that allows users to order food for pick up from a single restaurant. Hungry clients of this fictitious restaurant can visit its website, select one or more dishes and place an order for pick-up. They will receive a notification when their order is ready. When an order is placed the restaurant receives the order via SMS. The restaurant can then specify how long it will take to fulfill it. Once they provide this information, the website updates for the client and also notifies them via SMS.A modern telecom API servie also know as Twilio is used to implement SMS communcation from the website to the client and restaurant. This app was inspired by Ritual.
